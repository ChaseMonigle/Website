        <p>
          During my freshman year, I decided to take a leap of faith and become a
          <strong>Founding Father</strong> of the Theta Xi chapter at Florida Tech,
          which began with only eight members. It was a challenge and an
          opportunity — one that pushed me to grow both personally and
          professionally.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I helped expand the fraternity into a <strong>40+ member
          brotherhood</strong>. This experience taught me the value of teamwork,
          accountability, and persistence. As our membership grew, so did my
          responsibilities, eventually leading me to serve as <strong>Brotherhood
          Chair</strong>, where I worked to create events and traditions that
          strengthened our bonds and built a lasting culture of support.
        </p>
        <p>
          The journey wasn’t always easy, but it was deeply rewarding. I developed
          leadership, organizational, and conflict-resolution skills that I carry
          into every aspect of my academic and professional life. This past year,
          our fraternity achieved a milestone by being <strong>officially
          chartered</strong> — a recognition of the hard work and dedication of
          every member. As an added honor, I was featured on the <strong>front
          cover of Theta Xi’s national magazine</strong>, symbolizing not just my
          contributions but the collective success of our chapter.
