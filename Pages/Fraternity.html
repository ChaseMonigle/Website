        <p>
          During my freshman year, I decided to take a chance and become a
          <strong>Founding Father</strong> of the Theta Xi chapter at Florida Tech,
          starting with only eight members. It was an opportunity filled with
          challenges, but also one that pushed me to grow as a leader and
          teammate.
        </p>
        <p>
          Over time, I helped expand the chapter into a <strong>40+ member
          fraternity</strong>. Through this growth, I learned the importance of
          accountability, communication, and building a culture where every
          member feels valued. My involvement eventually led me to serve as
          <strong>Brotherhood Chair</strong>, where I worked to design events
          and traditions that strengthened the relationships and unity within
          our brotherhood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The experience taught me organizational and leadership skills that
          continue to shape how I approach challenges today. This past year,
          our chapter reached a major milestone when we were
          <strong>officially chartered</strong>. As a highlight of that moment,
          I had the honor of being featured on the <strong>front cover of Theta
          Xi’s national magazine</strong> — a recognition not just of my
          personal efforts, but of the collective dedication of our members.
